# GBTaxi
An gbff to SQL(sqlite3 database) data loader.
The SQL database was configured with DB Browser for SQLite

This is a "Hapy code", doesnt handle errors at all, is made to work with RefSeq gbff files. 
It havent been proved with GeneBank gbff files as those have a variable format that makes 
its handling more complicated.
